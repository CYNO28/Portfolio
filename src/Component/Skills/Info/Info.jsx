      <p className={style.text}>Hello! My name is Dinesh Singh Bisht and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
      My interest in web development started back in 2020 when I started learning HTML and CSS.
      I had a blast learning the basics of web development and I immediately fell in love with it.
      I decided to turn my interest into a career path by enrolling in a coding bootcamp.
